# Jupyter Notebooks

Repository for my Jupyter notebooks that conatains various analyses from my research projects and bits of code for simple statistical methods. Programming languages used here are Python and Julia. In some cases, the notebooks contain plots not featured in my publications and are meant to showcase the methodologies and calculations used. It is purely for education purposes. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at jhordanne.jones@uwi.edu.
